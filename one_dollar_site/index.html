        <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Photo of Andrew">
        <p>My name is Andrew, and for most of my life, people have said I was just “dealt a bad deck of cards.”</p>
        <p>I was raised in a world of addiction, abuse, and survival. My story includes unimaginable trauma — but also unshakable hope. I’m still standing, still fighting, and I believe with your help, I can finally start to live, not just survive.</p>
        <p>I’m asking for just $1 — from anyone willing to help change a life.</p>

        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>My mission is to share my story with others — especially in times of high stress, trauma, or hopelessness — to help build them back up. I believe love conquers all hardship. And no matter what you’ve been through, there is still hope, still good people, and still a reason to believe.</p>
